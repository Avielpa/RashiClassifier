# Learning Objectives - Team Coding Exercises

## 1. Overview & Structure

### 1.1 Purpose & Scope

This repository primarily serves as a platform for analyzing Rashi's Sefer HaMitzvot (Book of Commandments). However, it also provides an excellent learning environment for beginner coders to practice essential team development skills. The RashiClassifier project offers a real-world context for learning modern software development practices, from writing tickets to implementing features using AI-first coding principles.

The project combines traditional Jewish text analysis with modern software development techniques, offering a unique platform for both research and learning collaborative development practices.

    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#f1f8e9
```

The learning journey follows a structured progression from basic version control to advanced AI-assisted development practices. Each step builds upon previous skills while contributing to the primary goal of Rashi analysis.

### 1.3 Project-Based Learning Structure

    subgraph "Primary Research Context"
        A[RashiClassifier Project] --> B[Text Analysis]
        A --> C[Web Scraping]
        A --> D[Data Processing]
    end
    
    subgraph "Learning Activities"
        B --> E[Write User Stories]
        C --> F[Implement Features]
        D --> G[Test & Refactor]
    end
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#f3e5f5
    style F fill:#e8f5e8
    style G fill:#fff3e0
```

The project provides authentic context for learning, where students work on real features that contribute to a functional Rashi analysis system. This approach ensures that learning activities have genuine purpose and value for both research and skill development.

## 2. Core Learning Objectives

- **Git Workflow**: Branching, commits, pull requests, code reviews
- **TDD**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle with pytest
- **AI-First**: Effective prompting and AI code review
- **Team Communication**: User stories, feedback, documentation

## 3. Project Structure for Learning

### 3.1 Beginner-Friendly Entry Points

The RashiClassifier project offers multiple entry points for different skill levels:

- **Content Analysis**: Simple text processing tasks for Rashi's commentary
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs of commandment relationships
- **Web Scraping**: Understanding data extraction from Wikisource
- **API Development**: Building interfaces for accessing Rashi's text data

### 3.2 Progressive Complexity

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Skill Progression"
        A[Basic Text Processing] --> B[Data Analysis]
        B --> C[Machine Learning]
        C --> D[Full-Stack Features]
    end
    
    subgraph "Learning Milestones"
        E[First Pull Request] --> F[Test Coverage]
        F --> G[AI Collaboration]
        G --> H[Feature Ownership]
    end
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

Students can start with simple tasks and gradually take on more complex features as their skills develop, all while contributing to meaningful Rashi research.
